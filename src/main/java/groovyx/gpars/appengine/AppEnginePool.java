/**

 * {@link AppEnginePool} helps you using GPars on App Engine.

 * If you want to use parallel collection use {@link #withPool(Closure)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you want to use actors use {@link #getPGroup()} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that there are differences between running threads on frontend and
 * backend instance. All threads on frontend instance must finish within the
 * deadline limit (currently 30 seconds). There is also limit of having max. 10
 * thread active per request. Contrary there is no limit on backend threads
 * count. Backend threads can also run after the request has finished.
